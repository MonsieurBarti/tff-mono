# tff Conventions

## Entity Types

| Entity      | Description                  |
| ----------- | ---------------------------- |
| Project     | Top-level singleton          |
| Milestone   | Versioned delivery unit      |
| Slice       | Scoped work unit ∈ milestone |
| Task        | Atomic work item ∈ slice     |
| Requirement | AC scoped to milestone       |

## Status Flow

Items progress: `open` → `in_progress` → `closed`

### Slice States

```
discussing → researching → planning → executing → verifying → reviewing → completing → closed
```

Back-edges (loops):

- `planning → planning` (revision after {{artifact-review}} feedback)
- `verifying → executing` (replan after verification failure)
- `reviewing → executing` (fix after PR review changes requested)

### Human Gates

Transitions requiring explicit human approval:

- Plan approval (via {{artifact-review}} annotation on PLAN.md)
- Replan approval (if verification fails)
- Slice PR review (slice branch → milestone branch)
- Milestone PR review (milestone branch → main)

## Hierarchy

One project per repo (singleton enforcement).

```
Project
  └── Milestone (M01, M02, ...)
        ├── Requirements
        └── Slices (M01-S01, M01-S02, ...)
              └── Tasks (T01, T02, ...)
```

## Naming

- Milestone numbers: `M01`, `M02`, ... (human-readable labels)
- Slice IDs: `M01-S01`, `M01-S02`, ... (human-readable labels)
- Task refs: `T01`, `T02`, ... (local to slice)
- Branches:
  - Milestone: `milestone/<8hex>` (UUID prefix, e.g., `milestone/a1b2c3d4`)
  - Slice: `slice/<8hex>` (UUID prefix, e.g., `slice/12345678`)

**Note:** Entity IDs are UUIDs, not labels. Labels are computed from numbers for human readability. Branch names use the first 8 characters of the UUID for collision-safe naming.

## Commit Format

```
<type>(S01/T03): <summary>
```

Valid types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `test`, `docs`, `chore`

Special formats:

- Artifact: `docs(S01): <summary>`
- Rollback: `revert(S01/T03): <summary>`

## PR Title Format

PR titles become commit messages on `main` (via squash-merge). They MUST be conventional-commit
so downstream automation (release-please, changelog generation) can parse them.

- **Slice PR:** `<type>(S<NN>): <summary>` — e.g. `docs(S05): add e2e + README updates`.
- **Milestone PR:** `<type>(M<NN>): <milestone-name>` — e.g. `feat(M01): rule discovery expansion`.
- **Merge style:** ALWAYS squash-merge slice and milestone PRs. Merge-commit messages
  (`Merge pull request #N from …`) are unparseable.

Anti-pattern: `M01-S05: <summary>` (no `<type>`, no scope parentheses) — release-please skips it.

## Branch Discipline

Agents and humans work on **slice branches only** while a milestone has open slices. Two guards enforce this:

1. **Default-branch guard** — every mutating `tff-tools` command refuses to run when the current branch equals the repo's default branch (usually `main`). Error code: `REFUSED_ON_DEFAULT_BRANCH`. Remedy: create a milestone branch or slice worktree before proceeding.
2. **Milestone-branch guard** — `slice:transition`, `task:claim`, `task:close`, and `review:record` refuse to run on a `milestone/<8hex>` branch while any slice in that milestone is not `closed`. Error code: `REFUSED_ON_MILESTONE_BRANCH`. Remedy: switch to the slice worktree at `{{project-dir}}/worktrees/<slice-id>/`.

A pre-commit hook (`scripts/hooks/branch-guard.mjs`, registered in `lefthook.yml`) mirrors the milestone-branch guard at the git level: it blocks commits on a milestone branch while slices are open.

Once **all slices are closed**, small follow-up commits may go directly to the milestone branch. Two options:

- Close all slices first (normal flow), then commit on the milestone branch — no override needed.
- For one-off exceptions (e.g., hotfixes), set `TFF_ALLOW_MILESTONE_COMMIT=1` to bypass the pre-commit hook. The CLI guard always applies; the env var affects only the git hook.

## Project Directory

```
{{project-dir}}/
  PROJECT.md              ← project vision (markdown-authoritative)
  STATE.md                ← DERIVED, never edit manually
  settings.yaml           ← model profiles, quality gates
  milestones/
    M01/
      REQUIREMENTS.md     ← requirements scoped to this milestone
      slices/
        M01-S01/
          SPEC.md         ← design spec (produced during discuss)
          PLAN.md         ← slice plan and task descriptions
          RESEARCH.md     ← research notes
          CHECKPOINT.md   ← resumability data
  worktrees/
    M01-S01/              ← git worktree (gitignored)
```

Note: `{{project-dir}}/` in the repo is a symlink to `~/.tff/{projectId}/`, created by `project:init`. Direct `mkdir -p {{project-dir}}/…` before init is unsafe and will cause symlink creation to fail with "`{{project-dir}}/` exists as a real directory."

## State Rules

- State managed by SQLite via tff-tools
- STATE.md always derived, never hand-edited
- tff-tools = single source of truth for status ∧ dependencies

## Complexity Tiers

Classification at end of discuss. User confirms tier — ¬ auto-routing.

**S-tier criteria (ALL must be true):** ≤1 file affected, 0 new files, ¬ investigation needed, ¬ architecture impact, 0 unknowns.

All tiers follow same pipeline. Tiers control **depth**, ¬ which steps run.

| Tier                | Discuss             | Research | Plan Review         | Execute | Code Review                |
| ------------------- | ------------------- | -------- | ------------------- | ------- | -------------------------- |
| S (single-file fix) | Lightweight         | Skip     | {{artifact-review}} | No TDD  | Agent-only                 |
| SS (default)        | Full                | Optional | {{artifact-review}} | TDD     | Agent-only                 |
| SSS (complex)       | Full + brainstormer | Required | {{artifact-review}} | TDD     | Agent-only, multi-reviewer |

## tff-tools Patterns

### Task Claiming

Use `tff-tools task:claim <id>` to atomically claim task (sets assignee + status → in_progress).

### Adding Dependencies

Use `tff-tools dep:add <from-id> <to-id>` to create blocking dependencies between slices ∨ tasks.
`<from-id>` depends on (blocked by) `<to-id>`.

### Finding Ready Work

Use `tff-tools task:ready` to list unblocked tasks. Respects dependency graph — only tasks whose blockers all resolved appear.

### Closing with Reason

Always close with reason:

```bash
tff-tools slice:close <id> --reason "Completed — all AC met"
```

### Agent Session Pattern

```bash
# Claim atomically
tff-tools task:claim <task-id>

# Do work...

# Close with reason
tff-tools task:close <task-id> --reason "Completed"
```

## Tooling CLI

Canonical invocation: `tff-tools <command> [args]`.

When the plugin is installed in Claude Code, `$PLUGIN_ROOT/bin` is automatically on `PATH`, so the bare `tff-tools` name resolves to the bundled CLI in every Claude-launched shell. **Do not** reach for `bunx tff-tools`, `npx tff-tools`, or `which tff-tools` — the CLI is not published under that name on npm; it's registered via the plugin's `bin/` directory.

Fallback (hooks / scripts running outside an interactive shell, where PATH may differ): `node "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/dist/cli/index.js" <command> [args]`.

Returns JSON: `{ "ok": true, "data": ... }` ∨ `{ "ok": false, "error": { "code": "...", "message": "..." } }`
