/**
 * Explicit exemptions from transaction-wrap discipline.
 *
 * Two categories are legitimate:
 *   1. Read-only bootstrap paths that happen to call a method whose name
 *      matches the mutating prefix list but that does not actually mutate.
 *   2. Adapter lifecycle calls (init, checkpoint, close).
 *
 * Entries take the form `{ filePath, line, methodName, reason }`.
 * New entries require a one-line `reason` that explains why the call is
 * legitimately outside a transaction. Reviewers should reject new entries
 * that don't fit the two categories above.
